# üìä SELF-LEARNING PROJECT: Sales Data Cleaning and Visualization in Python

This is a **self-learning project** developed entirely for personal growth and hands-on practice.  
**NO DATA HAS BEEN COPIED OR SOURCED FROM ANY COMPANY OR EXTERNAL SOURCE.**  
All data is **dummy**, self-created, and generated solely for educational and portfolio-building purposes.

> üß† Built to simulate how real-world sales data is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using basic Python tools like loops, conditionals, pandas, and matplotlib.

## üîß What This Self-Learning Project Does

- Loads a raw `.csv` file containing dummy sales records
- Cleans the data using Python (`csv`, `if`, `for`):
  - Removes rows with missing customers, prices, or invalid quantities
- Calculates total revenue using basic math logic
- Saves the cleaned data into a new CSV file
- Generates two graphs using matplotlib:
  - üìä Revenue by Product (Bar Chart)
  - üìà Orders Over Time (Line Chart)
- Saves graphs as `.jpeg` images for reporting or portfolio use
